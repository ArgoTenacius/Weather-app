<br>
It was a TOP (the odin project) project made using an API, the <a href=https://openweathermap.org/api>OpenWeatherApi.</a>
Due to be using the free version of the API, it wasn't possible to make a precise forecast display, so no matter the hour, it will always display the 15, 18, 21, 00 of the day.

# Features
1. Display the initials of the country.
2. Display the temperature in celcius, the feels like, min and max temperature and humidity.
3. A forecast display (but not precise due to be using the free API).

# How to improve/Features to add.
1. Add a search bar helper (example if you write "Bos" it would display all locations with "Bos" on the name).
2. Add a precise and full forecast with a inner scroller.
3. Add a graph with the temperatures changes.
